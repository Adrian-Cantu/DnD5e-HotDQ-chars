DnD5e-HotDQ-Fellgernon
======================

Basic character information for my Dungeons and Dragons 5e _Hoard of the Dragon Queen_ campaign.

Has basic character information (excluding equipment and spells) and creates an interactive document to browse the data. The goal is to use it during the sessions to quickly reference some piece of character data.

Data can be viewed interactively [here](https://lcolladotor.shinyapps.io/DnD5e-HotDQ-chars/charsHotDQ.Rmd).
